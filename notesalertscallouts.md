# Examples of using notes/callouts

Here's a note:

<p class="alert alert-info">
    <strong>Note:</strong> To log in to your feed, credentials obtained from Active Directory can currently <strong>not</strong> be used as the various package management clients (such as Visual Studio or, the NuGet client or npm) don't support this. Private feeds will still require authentication to happen based on MyGet credentials. ADFS integration will only work for logging in to the MyGet web interface. 
</p>

Here's a warning:

<p class="alert alert-warning">

</p>

Here's a tip:

<p class="alert alert-success">

ANd very rarely used: a bold warning!
