# Web hooks

Web hooks can be used to perform actions based on an event, for example sending out a tweet when a package is pushed or updating an issue tracker when a build succeeds.

Every MyGet feed provides the option to communicate with external services, such as a web server, whenever a specific action occurs on the feed. These webhooks can be used to perform actions based on such event, for example sending out a tweet when a package is pushed or updating an issue tracker when a build succeeds. It's not always required to write custom code though: we integrate with a variety of services such as Twitter, Twilio, HipChat and starting today, with Visual Studio Online Team Rooms and Slack.

Only feed owners and co-owners can manage webhooks for a feed. Each webhook can be triggered for one or more event types, depending on the implementation. Webhook deliveries can be inspected, including full logs, as well as redelivered in case this is needed. 

The following events can be subscribed to:

* **Ping** - a communications test sending a simple message to the webhook endpoint
* **Package added** - a package has been added to a feed
* **Package deleted** - a package has been deleted from a feed
* **Package listed/unlisted** - a package has been listed/unlisted
* **Package pinned/unpinned** - a package has been pinned/unpinned
* **Package pushed** - a package has been pushed to an external feed
* **Build queued** - a build has been queued
* **Build started** - a build has started
* **Build finished** - a build has finished

## HTTP Post webhook

The most basic type of webhook implementation is our HTTP Post webhook. It sends raw event data, formatted as a JSON document, as an HTTP POST to a configured URL.

MyGet will make every HTTP request with the following headers:

<table class="table table-condensed">
	<thead>
    	<tr>
    	    <th>Header</th> 
    	    <th>Description</th>
    	</tr>
	</thead>
	<tbody>
		<tr><th><strong>Content-type</strong></th><td><code>application/vnd.myget.webhooks.v1+json</code></td>
		<tr><th><strong>User-Agent</strong></th><td>Will always have the prefix <code>MyGet Web Hook/</code></td>
		<tr><th><strong>X-MyGet-EventIdentifier</strong></th><td>A unique identifier for the event, which can be used to correlate diagnostics data and ensure a webhook payload is not handled more than once.</td>
	</tbody>
</table>

Let's go over some example payloads.

	<strong>Tip:</strong> Webhooks can be tested and debugged using a variety of tools. John Sheehan has an extensive list of them available <a href="http://john-sheehan.com/blog/ultimate-api-webhook-backend-service-debugging-testing-monitoring-and-discovery-tools-list">on his blog</a>.

### Ping

Here's an example of a *ping* payload:

## Service-specific webhooks

MyGet provides several service-specific webhooks:

* **Email** - sends the event as plain text or HTML to e-mail recipients
* **HipChat** - sends the event as a notification to a HipChat room
* **Slack** - sends the event to a Slack channel
* **Twilio** - sends the event as a plain text SMS to a phone
* **Twitter** - sends the event as a plain text tweet

Not all event types may be supported by these service-specific webhooks. Some payloads may be optional as well.

### Email webhook

The email webhook sends the event as plain text or HTML to e-mail recipients. It requires a few configuration values:

* **Host** - the SMTP server hostname
* **Port** - the SMTP server port
* **Use TLS?** - whether to use TLS or not
* **SMTP Username** - SMTP server username
* **SMTP password** - SMTP server password
* **From** - sender of the message
* **To** - recipients of the message (separated by semicolon)
* **Body** - whether to send the e-mail containing *raw JSON*, *plain text* or *HTML*

### HipChat webhook

The HipChat webhook sends the event as a notification to a HipChat room. The following configuration options must be provided:

* **AuthToken** - auth token ([Room token](https://hipchat.com/rooms) or [Personal token](https://hipchat.com/account/api))
* **Room** - room to which to send the notifaction
* **Server** - HipChat server URL, defaults to api.hipchat.com
* **Color** - background color for the notification (yellow, green, red, purple, gray or random)
* **Color build events based on status** - will color the message gray when a build is started, green when a build succeeds and red when a build fails
* **Notify participants** - determines if room participants should get a notification for the event or not

### Slack webhook

The Slack webhook sends the event as a notification to a Slack channel. The following configuration options must be provided:

* **Webhook URL** - a Slack [incoming webhook URL](https://www.slack.com/services/new/incoming-webhook)
* **Channel** - channel to which to send the notifaction

### Microsoft Teams webhook

The Microsoft Teams/Office 365 Groups webhook sends the event as a notification to a Microsoft Teams channel or Office 365 Group. The following configuration options must be provided:

* **Webhook URL** - an [incoming webhook URL](https://dev.outlook.com/Connectors/GetStarted)

### Twilio

The Twilio webhook sends the event as a plain text SMS to a phone. The following configuration options must be provided:

* **AuthenticationToken** - the Twilio account [authentication token](https://www.twilio.com/user/account)
* **From** - the number sending the message (must be a Twilio number enabled for SMS)
* **To** - the number to which the message will be sent

### Twitter

The Twitter webhook sends the event as a plain text tweet using OAuth credentials.

Before using this webhook, the following steps must be followed:

1. Create a [Twitter application](https://apps.twitter.com/). For the website, please use a URL of your own.
2. Modify the application permissions to *read & write*
3. Copy the API key and API secret and configure the MyGet webhook with it
4. Create an access token and configure the MyGet webhook with it

The following configuration options must be provided:

* **OAuth consumer key** - the OAuth consumer key (API key) obtained from [dev.twitter.com](http://dev.twitter.com)
