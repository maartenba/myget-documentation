#Creating a MyGet Feed

After logging in for the first time, you arrive at the CreateFeed form. It's simple. You only need: 
* name 
* description
* scope

(More details below)

## Feed Name

Naming things can be hard. It might be helpful to know at this stage:

 1. Your feed names are yours - they are prefixed with your username to make them unique. 
 2. If you change your mind about the feed name, you can delete your feed and start over. However, this is not a satisfactory option when you've already added many packages to the feed - you'd have to add them all again. (See the next point.)
 3. While there isn't a _Rename feed_ function, you can accomplish the same thing via the _Clone feed_ feature - even for a feed containing packages. 

## Feed Description

The description is for your benefit. It is only displayed on the Feed Details page. 

## Feed Scope

### Public feed

A public feed can be discovered and consumed by anyone. Only you can add packages to it. 

### Community feed

A community feed can also be discovered and consumed by anyone. Anyone can add packages to it. 

### Private feed

Only you have access, and those people you specifically invite to consume your private feed. Private feeds are only available to paying subscribers - after the 14-day free trial. There are limitations on the number of contributors who can add to a private feed. 

# What Happens Next?
