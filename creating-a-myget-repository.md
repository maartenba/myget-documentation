#Creating a MyGet Feed

After logging in for the first time, you arrive at the CreateFeed form. It's simple. You only need: 
* name 
* description
* scope

(More details below)

## Feed Name

Naming things can be hard. It might be helpful to know at this stage:
* Your feed names are yours - they are prefixed with your username to make them unique. 
* If you change your mind about the feed name, you can delete your feed and start over. (However, this isn't so good when you've already added packages to the feed.)
* While there isn't a _Rename feed_ function, you can accomplish the same thing via the _Clone feed_ feature - even for a feed containing packages. 

## Feed Description

The description is for your benefit. It is only displayed on the Feed Details page. 

## Feed Scope

Public, community or private, as explained on the form. (Note that private feeds are only available to paying subscribers - after the 14-day free trial.)

# What Happens Next?
