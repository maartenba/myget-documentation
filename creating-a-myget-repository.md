#Creating a MyGet Feed

After logging in for the first time, you arrive at the CreateFeed form. It's simple. You only need: 
* name 
* description
* scope

(More details below)

## Feed Name

Naming things can be hard. It might be helpful to know at this stage:

 1. Your feed names are yours - they are prefixed with your username to make them unique. 
 2. If you change your mind about the feed name, you can delete your feed and start over. However, this is not a satisfactory option when you've already added many packages to the feed - you'd have to add them all again. (See the next point.)
 3. While there isn't a _Rename feed_ function, you can accomplish the same thing via the _Clone feed_ feature - even for a feed containing packages. 

## Feed Description

The description is for your benefit. It is only displayed on the Feed Details page. 

## Feed Scope

Public, community or private, as explained on the form. (Note that private feeds are only available to paying subscribers - after the 14-day free trial.)

# What Happens Next?

When you click the `Create feed` button, your feed is set up, and you're taken to the next screen to add packages:
