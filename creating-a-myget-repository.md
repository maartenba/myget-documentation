# Creating a MyGet feed \(repository\)

After logging in for the first time, we can create a new feed \(repository\). All we'll need to provide is a feed name, description and its scope.

## Feed name

Naming things can be hard. It might be helpful to know at this stage:

1. The feed name will be used in URL's to work with the feed. Make it something you and team members can remember. Feed are always owned by a user, and in the UI they are prefixed with the feed owner's username.
2. If you change your mind about the feed name, the feed can be deleted and a new feed can be ceated. However, this is not a satisfactory option when there are already many packages on the feed - we'd have to add them all again.
3. While there isn't a _Rename feed_ function, we can accomplish the same thing via the _Clone feed_ feature - even for a feed containing packages. 

## Feed description

The feed description is for your benefit. It is displayed on the Feed Details page. When a feed is published to the gallery, the feed description is also used there to provide a short description of what is on this feed.

## Feed Scope

### Public feed

A public feed can be discovered and consumed by anyone. Only you can add packages to it.

### Community feed

A community feed can also be discovered and consumed by anyone. Anyone can add packages to it.

### Private feed

Only you have access, and those people you specifically invite to consume your private feed. Private feeds are only available to paying subscribers - after the 14-day free trial. There are limitations on the number of contributors who can add to a private feed.

# What Happens Next?

When you click the `Create feed` button, your feed is set up, and you're taken to the next screen to add packages:
