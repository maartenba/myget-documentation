# What is MyGet?

Struggling with software dependencies? Spending more effort maintaining or fixing them instead of creating value? Having a hard time to share in-house components between developers and projects, while being flooded with tons of open source components through one or more of the package managers out there? Hate it when you can't debug or step through the code of consumed packages? 

With MyGet, software dependencies are easy to work with! MyGet makes package management a breeze by leveraging package managers such as NuGet, npm, Bower, Maven, VSIX, ..., and by providing innovative services to both software development professionals and the community. We believe that removing roadblocks and reducing friction through automation and integration is key to success in a high-paced and technology-centric world.

MyGet provides hosted package repositories for individual developers, open source projects and corporate development teams. Create feeds and private repositories for your developers, clients or the entire world using secured access.  Work together using activity streams and RSS. Push your symbols packages too and enable a smooth debugging experience for your package consumers.

MyGet repositories can contain your own libraries, artifacts as well as third party packages. In fact, packages can come from your build server, upstream repositories such as NuGet.org, Mpmjs.org and  Maven Central, as well as Visual Studio Team Services, GitHub, BitBucket or CodePlex where we transform your source code into a compiled NuGet package. 

Audit dependencies used by your organization. Support your release process with configurable upstream package sources, versioning rules, package filters and staged dependencies.

No need to distract your DevOps teams with setting up yet another range of development-critical servers. Focus on your core-business and let MyGetâ€™s experts handle it for you!  Our most experienced cloud engineers ensure an up-to-date, highly available, scalable, and performant service, securely accessible from wherever you are. Our expertise also ensures your service will always be up to date and compatible with the latest evolutions in package manager protocols, ensuring you can always benefit from the latest and greatest client upgrades.
