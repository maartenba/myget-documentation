# MyGet 2017.1 Release Notes

MyGet 2017.1 was released on June 1, 2017.

## Highlights

This 2017.1 release of MyGet again adds some new functionality to the service.

Major highlights of this release are:

We've built a **MyGet Credential Provider for Visual Studio 2017**! This extension allows you to authenticate against your MyGet feeds using OAuth. [**Install it from the Visual Studio Gallery!**](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/vsgallery/79609fc1-58d5-4a31-a171-124b952ca9e0)

We added **Maven** support, and welcome all Java/Android developers to the MyGet family! \([Learn more](/package-managers/maven.md "Learn more about MyGet&apos;s support for Maven!")\)

We've built a web utility to help you learn and adopt Semantic Versioning: check out our [**MyGet SemVer Explorer**](http://semver.myget.org)[!](http://semver.myget.org/%29**!)

We've partnered with [OSSIndex](http://ossindex.net) and [Vor Security](http://www.vorsecurity.com) to check for potential package vulnerabilities on your MyGet feeds! \([Learn more](/how-to/package-vulnerabilities.md "Learn more about MyGet&apos;s package vulnerability reports!")\)

## Features

### MyGet \(all plans\)

The following applies to **all** MyGet plans!

#### NPM

* added support for token authentication
* added support for upstream token authentication, which now also supports Telerik's NPM registry as an upstream package source
* added support for the _fast search_ endpoint
* added support for package deprecation
* added support for package tagging
* added support for dist-tag

#### NuGet

* added support for NuGet's SemVer2 protocol, and added support for modifying build metadata on push upstream dialog

#### Maven \(NEW!\)

* added support for Maven artifacts
* added support for Android AAR artifacts
* added support for mirroring Maven package sources
* added support for proxying Maven packages sources
* added support for pushing Maven packages to upstream Maven package sources

#### Symbols

* added a toggle to support pushing symbols to upstream package sources
* when the upstream target feed is a MyGet feed, we automatically also push the symbols upstream
* SymbolSource.org integration has been retired in favor of MyGet's own Symbols functionality

#### Usability

* no longer show symbols packages separately on the Gallery's feed details view
* minor modifications to the Gallery feed details UI to improve the user experience
* added a _download all_ button to the packages dropdown in build results view
* hide pre-authenticated feed endpoints from Feed Details view when the feed is not a private feed
* added a \_copy-to-clipboard \_button to the connection details popup on Gallery feeds

#### Security

* introduced a **MyGet Credential Provider for Visual Studio 2017**! This extension allows you to authenticate against your MyGet feeds using OAuth.
* consolidated the login page: one page to rule them all!
* no longer display access tokens on the web site \(you can still copy them though\)
* auditing improvements
* added support for **scoped API keys**: access tokens can now be scoped to _feed and privilege scopes_, in addition to already existing token expiration support.
* added OSSIndex.net integration to **detect package vulnerabilitie**s and report them on your feed details view

### MyGet Enterprise

The enterprise plan has all functionality from the paid subscription plans, _and more_!

The following applies only to the MyGet Enterprise plan:

#### Usability

* the Gallery index is now the default landing page when authenticated on MyGet Enterprise

#### Security

* added support for marking users as _external to the tenant_. This prevents the external user from accessing _Enterprise feeds_, unless privileges are explicitly assigned at the feed level. \(see [Feed Types](http://docs.myget.org/docs/reference/security#Available_Feed_Types)\)

### MyGet Build Services

* added support for **building and packaging Maven / Android **AAR artifacts!
* added support for **Visual Studio 2017**, **.NET Core** and the new **PackageReference** project format \([Learn more](http://blog.myget.org/post/2017/03/15/visual-studio-2017-and-net-core-support-on-myget.aspx)\)
* `AssemblyInfo` patching now supports globbing patterns \(like `**\*.cs`\)

### Bug Fixes & Other Improvements

* MyGet has been upgraded to run on .NET Framework 4.6.2, which seemed to have positive effect on **performance**
* overwriting source symbols is now blocked when forbid overwrite is enabled on the feed
* fixed a bug in semantic version range parsing of npm dependencies \(tilde and carret ranges\)
* show quota per feed on user profile page \(helps answer the question: _which of my feeds consumes most?_\)
* fixed an issue caused by breaking changes in the VSTS API \(repository `remoteUrl` returned by VSTS API suddenly no longer contained VSTS collection name\)
* fixed an issue in the Gallery index view related to feed icons
* fixed an issue that caused an HTTP 500 when a nuspec contained some invalid data
* fixed an issue that caused NPM push upstream to fail when no package description was given
* fixed an issue with the symbols code browser when a file was not found or could not be displayed
* NuGet: allow packages.config files to be uploaded without version number specified

We love hearing from you, so keep that [feedback](http://myget.uservoice.com) coming! MyGet is built for _you_!

_Happy packaging!_
